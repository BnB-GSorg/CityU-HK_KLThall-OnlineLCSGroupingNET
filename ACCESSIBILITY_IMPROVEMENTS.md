# Accessibility Improvement: Custom Confirmation Modal

## Issue Resolved
Replaced the inaccessible browser `confirm()` dialog with a custom accessible modal confirmation dialog to improve user experience and accessibility compliance.

## Problem
The original implementation used `confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this room?')` which had several accessibility issues:
- Not accessible to screen readers
- Poor keyboard navigation support
- No ARIA attributes for semantic information
- Browser-dependent styling that couldn't be customized
- Limited functionality and poor user experience

## Solution
Implemented a custom modal confirmation dialog with the following accessibility features:

### Accessibility Features
1. **ARIA Attributes**: 
   - `role="dialog"`
   - `aria-modal="true"`
   - `aria-labelledby` pointing to the modal title
   - `aria-describedby` pointing to the modal message

2. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Tab key cycles between Cancel and Delete buttons
   - Escape key cancels the modal and closes it
   - Focus trapping within the modal
   - Automatic focus on the safer option (Cancel button)

3. **Focus Management**:
   - Stores previous focus before opening modal
   - Restores focus to the trigger element after closing
   - Prevents focus from leaving the modal while open

4. **Screen Reader Support**:
   - Semantic HTML structure with proper headings
   - Descriptive content for context
   - Clear action buttons with meaningful labels

### Technical Implementation
- **Function**: `showConfirmationModal(title, message, confirmCallback, cancelCallback)`
- **Cleanup**: `hideConfirmationModal()` with proper DOM cleanup
- **Focus Trapping**: `trapFocus()` function for keyboard navigation
- **Event Handling**: Keyboard (Tab, Escape) and mouse (click outside) events

### Usage Example
```javascript
// Before (inaccessible)
if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this room?')) {
    deleteRoom();
}

// After (accessible)
showConfirmationModal(
    'Delete Room',
    'Are you sure you want to delete this room? This action cannot be undone.',
    function() { deleteRoom(); },  // confirm callback
    function() { /* cancel */ }    // cancel callback
);
```

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- ✅ Keyboard-only navigation
- ✅ Screen readers (tested with browser accessibility tools)

## Testing Completed
- ✅ Desktop functionality (create, confirm, cancel, delete)
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness (390px width tested)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Escape, Enter)
- ✅ Focus management and restoration
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility (ARIA attributes)
- ✅ Click-outside-to-cancel behavior

## Files Modified
- `script.js`: Replaced `deleteRoom()` function and added custom modal functions
- `styles.css`: Added styling for `.confirmation-modal` and related classes

## Impact
This change significantly improves the accessibility of the application, making it compliant with WCAG guidelines and providing a better user experience for all users, especially those using assistive technologies.
